# BlissfulMind

The assignment was to create a single page portfolio. I chose to express myself in a simple yet creative way by combining images, colors, and even designing the background myself.
I took the liberty to go above and beyond the regular requirements by adding in Div containers and then combining them with flex-box to control the placement of images and 
text-boxes which took a bit of research on my part.

### Tech

- HTML (Rubric requirement)
- CSS (Rubric Requirement)



## For the Future
Change some of the information about myself and maybe update where I currently am both in life and in my career. 

Color changes to background and "trim" to match that of the season. => seasonal updates

At the top of the site, there is information about me that I wish to change into clickable text to allow you into the other pages of the site. 

Ultimately, I want to flex my ability with HTML and CSS but I do want my portfolio to be a little more caught up with the times so may switch over to React/Bootstrap to provide a 
better and more dynamic user experience.
