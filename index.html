            <h3>Hello, I am Alex Diaz</h3>
            <p>I am currently enrolled in Thinkful's Software Engineering Flex Program. </p>
            <p>Mexican immigrant, spanish speaking, silver-tongued, snake hating super average human here!</p>
            <p>Right now, I live in Atlanta, Georgia but I will be moving out to Iowa very soon. I am very much excited to start this new chapter of my life! </p>

            <h3>Blissful Mind</h3>
            <p>I like to </p><ol id="hobbies">
                <li>play video games</li>
                <li>stream</li>
                <li>work-out</li>
            </ol> 
            <p>I took the online alias, Bliss, because happiness is what we are all after. Under those terms, we are all very 
                much the same but I believe there is more to people. Each one of us is simply creating our own path every minute of every day.</p>
            <p>At the core, I believe we are all created to create. Creating things brings me joy because I am able to make my imagination become a reality and it
                allows me to share my adventure in a unique way. I have even used my abilities to create communities online that brought people all around the world together.</p>
            <p>The ties between bringing people together and my competitive nature have molded me to be an advantageous leader. </p>
